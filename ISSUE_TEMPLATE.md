To help with identifying and fixing issues, please include as much information as possible, including:
### LazyLibrarian version number (at the bottom of config page)
### Operating system (windows, mac, linux, etc)
### Interface in use (default, bookstrap)
### Relevant debug log with api keys redacted
Please note - usually a single line of log is not sufficient. The lines jut before the error occurs can give useful context and greatly assist with debugging
